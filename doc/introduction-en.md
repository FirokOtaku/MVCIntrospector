# Introduction

When creating project of Spring Boot + MyBatis,  
you always need to create whole set of structures
(mapper + service + service impl + controller)
for each bean.  
That's disgusting.

With MVCI, you only need to give those bean class an annotation.

MVCI will automatically create these structures
for you at compile phase.
